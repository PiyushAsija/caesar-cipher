# üîê Caesar Cipher ‚Äì Python Implementation

This is a simple Python program that can **encrypt and decrypt text** using the **Caesar Cipher algorithm**.  
It allows users to input a message and a shift value, then performs encryption or decryption accordingly.

## üìñ About Caesar Cipher
The **Caesar Cipher** is one of the oldest and simplest encryption techniques, used by Julius Caesar.  
It works by shifting each letter in the text by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.

- Example (Shift = 3):  
  - Plaintext: **HELLO**  
  - Ciphertext: **KHOOR**

---

## ‚ö° Features
- Encrypt text with a given shift value  
- Decrypt text back to the original message  
- Works for both **uppercase and lowercase** letters  
- Ignores non-alphabetic characters (keeps them unchanged)

## üñ•Ô∏è How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PiyushAsija/caesar-cipher.git
   cd caesar-cipher

## üìå Example

Encryption
Enter your message: HELLO
Enter the shift value: 3
Enter 1 for Encryption or 2 for Decryption: 1

Encrypted text is: KHOOR

Decryption
Enter your message: KHOOR
Enter the shift value: 3
Enter 1 for Encryption or 2 for Decryption: 2

Decrypted text is: HELLO
